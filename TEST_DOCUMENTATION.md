## Running Tests

### 1. Using Django Test Runner

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run specific app tests
python manage.py test users
python manage.py test kyc
python manage.py test campaigns
python manage.py test payments

# Run specific test class
python manage.py test users.tests.UserModelTest

# Run specific test method
python manage.py test users.tests.UserModelTest.test_create_user
```

### 2. Using Custom Test Runner

```bash
# Run all Phase 1 tests
python run_tests.py

# Run specific test suite
python run_tests.py users.tests
```

### 3. Using Pytest (Recommended)

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific app tests
pytest users/
pytest kyc/
pytest campaigns/
pytest payments/

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test markers
pytest -m "user"
pytest -m "kyc"
pytest -m "campaign"
pytest -m "payment"
```

## Test Configuration

    python run_tests.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors**
- Ensure test database is configured
- Check database permissions
- Verify test settings are loaded

**Import Errors**
- Check Python path configuration
- Verify app is in INSTALLED_APPS
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

**Test Data Issues**
